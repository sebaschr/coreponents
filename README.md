# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This project is meant to be a boilerplate or a base for the frontend of new projects built on React. It's a list of components working together that should simplify the process of building a frontend. It includes basic react routing, theming, spaces, and different constants.

## THEMES

Right now only Light & Dark themes are enabled but if you'd like to add new themes please add them to them 'constants.ts' file and the $themes array in 'colors.scss', this will be the same for any CSS changes such as adding a new color or changing a color value.

You can see a live functioning demo on:
